# Machine Learning in Matlab

This repository contains Matlab classes that cover the following topics:

* Supervised learning: parametric/non-parametric algorithms, support vector machines, 
kernels, neural networks.
* Unsupervised  learning:  Clustering,  dimensionality  reduction,  recommender  systems,  deep 
learning 
* Best practices in machine learning by using Matlab: bias/variance theory, innovation process 
in machine learning and Artificial Intelligence.
